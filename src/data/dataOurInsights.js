                development companies in the region. The Boolean Tech has a zeal in this sector that.
                The key requirement of this work package is the development of a database (and
                supporting summary report), compiling information for potential renewable energy
                business and technology solutions to help overcome environmental and climatic
                challenges in the NPA programme region. Technology solutions cover installation,
                operation and maintenance of equipment, not the design and manufacture of
                components.

                The objective of the database is to identify the main environmental and climatic
                challenges, and outline technological and business solutions to these challenges, creating
                a database of these for 8 different categories of renewable energy technology. It is
                designed for use by new and existing renewable energy businesses, to inform them of
                the challenges they may face in developing their business and how these will be
                overcome.

                A range of examples (where available) have been highlighted on how the challenges
                identified have been overcome. Specific regional related innovations and smart solutions
                from local business on technology driven RE-solutions have been documented, with the
                intention of passing on this knowledge to other regions in the NPA not involved in the
                GREBE Project.

                Global climate change impacts Europe in many ways, including: changes in average and
                extreme temperature and precipitation, warmer oceans, rising sea level and shrinking
                snow and ice cover on land and at sea. These weather phenomenons have led to a
                range of impacts on ecosystems, socio-economic sectors and human health and safety.
                There is no doubt that the changes in climate will have a strong impact in our daily life,
                whether we accept extreme weather conditions as a new phenomenon or not.

                Adaptation to the past history data, present observed and future predicted impacts will
                in the coming decades be needed, as well as be complementary to global climate
                mitigation actions. Narvik Science Park has made a report on this in the GREBE-Project.
